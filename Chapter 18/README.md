We'll write a web application called Learning Log that allows useres to log the topics they're interested in and make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries. When you're researching a new topic, maintaining a journal of what you've learned can help you keep track of new information and information you've already found. This is especially true then studying technical subjects. A good app, like the one we'll be creating, can help make this process more efficient.
